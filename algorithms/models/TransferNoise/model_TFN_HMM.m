% Class definition for Transfer Function Noise (TFN) model for use with HydroSight
%
% Description: 
%   The class defines a transfer function Noise (TFN) model for
%   simulating time series of groundwater head. The model should be
%   defined, calibrated and solved using HydroSight() or 
%   the graphical user interface.
%
%   This class uses an object-oriented structure to provide a highly flexible 
%   model structure and the efficient inclusion of new structural
%   componants. Currently, linear and nonlinear TFN model can be built.
%   The linear models are based upon von Asmuth et al. 2002 and von Asmuth et al. 
%   2008 and the nonlinear models use a nonlinear transform of the input
%   climate data to account for runoff and nonlinear free drainage (see
%   Peterson & Western, 2014) 
%
%   Additional key features of the model include:
%
%       - long term historic daily climate forcing is used to estimate the
%       groundwater head at each time point via use of continuous transfer
%       function. 
%
%       - the non-linear response of groundwater head to climate forcing
%       can be accounted for by transforming the input forcing data.
%       Currently, a simple 1-D vertically integrated soil model is
%       available (see climateTransform_soilMoistureModels), allowing the
%       construction of a soil model with between 1 and 7 parameters.
%
%       - Pumping drawdown can be simulated using the Ferris-Knowles 
%       response function for confined aquifers, the Ferris-
%       Knowles-Jacobs function for an unconfined aquifer
%       or the Hantush function for a leaky aquifer. Each of these
%       functions allow multiple production bores to be accounted for and
%       each can have recharge or no-flow boundary conditions.
%
%       - The influence of streamflow can be approximated using the Bruggeman 
%       reponse function. Importantly, this function is a prototype and
%       should be used with caution. It is likely that the covariance
%       between rainfall and streamflow complicates the estimation of the
%       impacts of streamflow.
%
%       - a model can be fit to irregularly sampled groundwater head
%       observations via use of an exponential noise function.
%
%       - new data transfer functions can easily be defined simply
%       by the creation of new response function class definitions.
%
%       - calibration of the model is not to the observed head, but to the
%       innovations between time steps. That is, the residual between the
%       observed and modelled head is derived and the innovation is
%       calculated as the prior residual minus the later residual
%       multiplied by the exponental noise function.
%
%       - the contribution of a given driver to the head is calculated as
%       the integral of the historic forcing times the weighting function.
%       This is undertaken by get_h_star() and the mex .c compiled function
%       doIRFconvolution(). If the forcing is instantaneous (for example a
%       flux a soil moisture model) then Simpon's integration is
%       undertaken. However, if the forcing is a daily integral (such as
%       precipitation or daily pumping volumes) then daily trapazoidal
%       integration of the weighting function is undertaken and then 
%       multiplied by the daily flux.
%

%% Calculate objective function vector. 
        function [objFn_1,objFn_2, h_star1,h_star2, colnames, drainage_elevation] = objectiveFunction(params, time_points, obj, varargin)
% objectiveFunction calculates the objective function vector. 
%
% Syntax:
%   [objFn, h_star, colnames, drainage_elevation] = objectiveFunction(params,time_points, obj)
%
% Description:
%   Solves the model for the input parameters and calculates the objective
%   function vector. Importantly, the objective function vector is not
%   simply the difference between the observed and modelled heads. Because
%   the model uses a noise model, the residual between the observed 
%   and modelled head is first derived and then the innovation
%   is calculated as the prior residual minus the later residual multiplied
%   by the exponental noise function. Finally, the objective function
%   weights this vector according to the time-step between observations.
%
%   Imporantly, the numerator of the weighting equation from von Asmuth et al 2002
%   rounds to zero when the number of samples is very large. This occurs
%   because it is effecively a geometric mean and its product term for n
%   (where n is the number of observation for calibration minus 1) rounds
%   to zero as a result of machine precision. This was overcome by adoption
%   of a restructuring of the geometric meazn in term of exp and log terms. 
%
% Inputs:
%   params - column vector of the optima parameters derived from
%   calibration.
%
%   time_points - column vector of the time points to be simulated.  
%
%   obj -  model object
%
% Outputs:
%   objFn - scalar objective function value.
%
%   h_star - matrix of the contribution from various model components and
%   their summed influence. The matrix columns are in the order of:
%   date/time, summed contribution to the head, contribution from
%   component i.
%
%   colnames - column names for matrix 'head'.
%
%   drainage_elevation - drainage elevation constant.
